<p>Bevan is a reworking of a traditional slab serif display typeface created by Heinrich Jost in the 1930s. In Bevan, Jost's earlier letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers.</p>

Bevan Stencil is a re-reworking of the aforementioned font to include bridges (all of equal size) to the islands withing the characters. Thus, turning this nice blocky font into a stencil variant of the original font.
